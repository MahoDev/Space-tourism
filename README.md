# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism website

![Design preview for the Space tourism website coding challenge](/preview-images/preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

# The challenge

The challenge is is to build out a multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as React or Vue. You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

### Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

# Technology Used

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Pure Javascript

# My comments

This project was helpful for improving my SCSS and javascript skills.

I was interested in how big frameworks allow for the making of SPAs and I wanted to try doing something similar on my own using pure javascript, since I haven't learned any framework yet. And I think I did a good job.

As for SCSS...Honestly I didn't like it much. The way it allows for organization of projects and its time saving syntax was nice, but I felt like the time I spend organzing everything up took more than the time saved.

I think Tailwind would be my go to tool for styling from now on.

However, this is my first time using SCSS, so maybe I need more practice with it to see its benefit.
